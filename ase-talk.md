# Fail forward?

## Give yourself the freedom to make mistakes

Short feedback cycles. This high addictive game has a short feedback cycle. This how our development evironment should be. But there must be many feedback cycles, and at many levels. This essential for our learning exeperience.

# Reproducibility

WRF - support example:
- "It work a month a go". Is something changed? I don't think I have large-file-support
- 4-6 weeks to sort out what the problem really was (could have done much faster if one of us were more WRF-fluent)

# Reusable

- Witness development cycles like a bush not as a three.
- A cycle is a PhD-thesis.
- Loss of our most precious resource - time
- Someone comes after us - could be our future self
